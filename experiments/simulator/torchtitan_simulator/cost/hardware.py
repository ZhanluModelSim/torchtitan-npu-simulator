"""Hardware profiles for the *explicit* duration-prediction path.

The simulator itself models no timing; :mod:`torchtitan_simulator.cost`
annotates workload facts, and duration prediction is an opt-in layer that
consumes those facts through the workspace's ``operator-performance-models``
roofline package (``max(cube, memory) + overhead`` with log-utilization
curves).  The profile below is calibrated against idle-NPU GEMM measurements
taken on the real device (qwen35-real container, BF16):

- cube BF16 peak 294.912 TFLOPS -- the 910B3 figure used across this workspace
  (torchtitan-npu ``metrics.py``); the largest measured GEMM (8192^3) sustains
  260 TFLOPS, so the peak is not overreached.
- cube utilization ``LogUtilization(k, b, min_ratio, max_ratio)`` -- calibrated
  exclusively on idle-device BF16 GEMM microbenchmarks (qwen35-real container,
  back-to-back launch timing): a square ladder 256..8192 plus a 3x3
  MxN grid at K=4096, cube-bound points only (n=16).  The fit set is chosen
  before evaluation and contains no target-workload shapes; residuals on it
  are median 0.92x, p90 3.54x (clamp region).  The 1-D FLOPs law is a known
  simplification: same-FLOPs shape families deviate from it (deep-K / tiny-M
  GEMMs run 3-6x below the curve, quantified below).
- HBM 3.07 TB/s peak with a constant 0.40 efficiency -- calibrated on
  idle-device contiguous bf16 copy (read+write) at 256MB/1GB: the stream
  sustains 1.22-1.24 TB/s.  Sizes up to ~64MB run faster (up to 4.3 TB/s,
  L2-resident operands); that cache boost is intentionally not modeled, so
  small-kernel copy time is overestimated.
- vec peak is an uncalibrated placeholder: every vec-family model in this
  module is memory-bound at the declared equivalent-op counts (verified per
  family), so the placeholder never dominates; it only satisfies the
  ChipCapabilities structure.
- ``overhead_us`` 3.0 -- the kernel-duration floor observed in NPU traces.

Honest measured-vs-predicted gaps (model/real, >1 means the model is longer),
validated per trace kernel on the qwen3.5 dense trace (66k mapped kernels):

- matmul: aggregate 0.75x (5.25 vs 7.02 ms); per-kernel median 1.22x,
  p10-p90 0.70-2.19x.
- adamw: per-kernel median 0.85x -- but the well-streaming fused kernel
  sustains 2.3 TB/s, above the clone-calibrated copy bandwidth, so the
  sim-side fused step (whole model, one node) lands ~2.1x over the measured
  optimizer time.
- fused vec activations (silu family, rsqrt, exp): 1.8-2.4x over -- the
  real fused kernels run 0.9-1.7 us, below the flat 3 us launch overhead.
- reductions (sum/mean) and log-softmax: 0.24-0.50x (2-4x under) -- multi-pass
  kernels that do not reach copy bandwidth with single-pass traffic.
- copy/transform kernels (TransData/Cast/Slice/Transpose...): ~0.45x
  (2.2x under) -- layout conversion runs well below copy bandwidth and the
  real per-kernel floor is 5-8 us, not 3 us.
- Known capture-side gaps the cost model cannot see: MemSet (167 ms/step,
  shape-less in the trace), PadV3 (63 ms), Conv2D family (36 ms) and other
  unmodeled kernel types (107 ms total) have no corresponding workload nodes
  or no clean semantics yet.
