"""Normalize EP_token_exchange annotations on token-exchange shape queries.

``aten.sym_size.int`` can inherit the annotation of its all-to-all producer.
Remove only that key for queries of an in-body token-exchange launch, then let
the upstream collector perform its normal validation and wait normalization.

Remove this module after the TorchTitan dependency includes the PR.
